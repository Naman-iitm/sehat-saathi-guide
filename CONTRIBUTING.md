## 🧑‍💻 Coding Guidelines
**TypeScript / React**

+ Use functional components
+ Prefer hooks over class components
+ Maintain strict TypeScript typing
+ Avoid any unless absolutely necessary

**Styling**

+ Use Tailwind CSS utilities consistently
+ Follow existing design patterns
+ Ensure mobile-first responsiveness

**Accessibility**

+ Use semantic HTML
+ Ensure keyboard navigation
+ Follow ARIA guidelines (Radix UI helps, don’t fight it)

**🌍 Localization Guidelines**

When contributing translations:

+ Keep medical terms accurate and culturally appropriate
+ Avoid slang or informal wording
+ Maintain consistency across languages
+ If unsure about a translation, add a comment
+ All language files should remain UTF-8 encoded.

🔐 Health, Safety & Ethics (Very Important)

This project provides health-related information, not diagnoses.

***Contributors must not:***

+ Add medical advice that appears authoritative or diagnostic
+ Remove disclaimers
+ Introduce fear-based or misleading health content
+ Collect personal health data without explicit discussion
+ When in doubt, err on the side of caution.

**🧪 Testing Expectations**

Before opening a Pull Request:

+ Ensure the app builds successfully
+ Test your feature in at least one language
+ Check mobile and desktop layouts if UI is affected

If you cannot add automated tests, describe how you tested manually.

## 🔁 Submitting a Pull Request

Before submitting, confirm:

 + Code runs locally
 + No unnecessary files committed
 + Relevant documentation updated
 + Translations tested (if applicable)

Then:

+ Push your branch
+ Open a Pull Request against main

Clearly explain:

+ What you changed
+ Why it was needed
+ How it was tested

## 🧠 Review Process

+ Maintainers may request changes
+ Feedback will be constructive and direct
+ Discussions are encouraged
+ Respectful disagreement is welcome
+ Quality and user impact matter more than speed.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the [Code_of_Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

In short:

+ Be respectful
+ Be inclusive
+ No harassment or discrimination
+ Build a safe space for learning and collaboration

## 🌟 New Contributors

If you’re new to open source:

+ Start small
+ Ask questions
+ Learn as you go

Everyone was new once. Effort and honesty matter more than perfection.

## 🙌 Final Note

***Sehat Saathi*** is more than a project.
It’s a commitment to accessible, ethical, and inclusive healthcare technology.

If your contribution helps even one person navigate health information more confidently, it matters.

**Thank you for building with us. 💚**
